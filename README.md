AutoHandbrake
=============

A script to automate DVD ripping with Handbrake

Currently just parses example output fron HandbrakeCLI and attempts to determine if it contains a film or TV episodes.

The eventual goal is to provide a "Wizard" which will automatically select, rip and name the appropriate titles from a DVD.
